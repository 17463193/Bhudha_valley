                <h2>Welcome to Buddha Valley Website</h2>
            <p style="font-size:15px">A peaceful sanctuary nestled in the mountains. 
       Our mission is to provide a space for individuals to connect with themselves,
       each other, and nature through meditation and mindfulness practices.
	   Our retreat center was founded in 2010 by a group of dedicated practitioners 
       who wanted to create a space where people could escape the stress and chaos of daily 
       life and find inner peace and clarity.</p>
